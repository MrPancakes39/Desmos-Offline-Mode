# Desmos | Offline Mode

Desmos is a well known Graphing Calculator available for the web and mobile, but no desktop port exist.

Desmos Offline Mode is a desktop port of Desmos Web Version, with the added feature of working offline.

## Update 2

I graduated from university and will be working on this (hopefully) weekly, you can see the development being made on the develop branch.

## Update

Source has been archived under the tag [archive/main](https://github.com/MrPancakes39/Desmos-Offline-Mode/tree/archive/main). To build v1.0.0 clone the repo and then do `git checkout archive/main`. Follow the instructions in the `REAME.md` file in the archive to continue.

## Why?

After the release of v1.0.0, I contacted desmos support to see if they were cool with the thing. Support said they can't give permission and to not host their code on GitHub. I thought next update was gonna release sooner but it's more than a year later and still haven't finished due to University and other issues. So I decided to finally remove the code to honor the respectful desmos support team.

I am working on the next release this is not a dead project and I'll try to contact desmos again once the next update releases with all it's changes.
